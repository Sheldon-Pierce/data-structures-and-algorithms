<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Implement a simplified LEFT JOIN for 2 Hashmaps.
## Whiteboard Process
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->
[Whiteboard Image](codeChallenge33.png)
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Split the sentence and then loop through words adding them to the hashmap.

Big O time and space is O(n)
## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
pytest tests/code_challenges/test_hashtable_left_join.py


(Output is exactly the same as the expected, just not in the same order.)
